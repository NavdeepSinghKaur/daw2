<!-- in the end, send only an index to the card component, which will load the image path
do an if else in the html to load the front side for 10 secs
to make the images combine when clicked the correct ones, look for the index of the clicked image, if is the index of the first clicked +1, correct, if not, wrong
from that function, call another one, which will se if the total number of correct clicks is 10, if so, ok else remain playing -->

@for (index of randomList; track $index) {
    <app-card (clicked)="cardClicked(index)" [cardIndex]="index"></app-card>
